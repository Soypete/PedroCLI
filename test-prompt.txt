I want to write a blog post about how we're managing context in PedroCLI's blog agent system.

The key innovation is breaking the workflow into 7 distinct phases, where each phase operates on a limited context window. This means we can run the entire blog generation on local models with just 16K context, like Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B on an M1 Max.

Please include code examples from the actual codebase - specifically look at pkg/agents/blog_content.go to show how the phased workflow works. Show the phaseGenerateSections method and explain how we generate each section independently to keep token usage under 2,500 tokens per section.

Also analyze my writing style from my Substack RSS feed and make sure the blog post matches my authentic voice.
